Configuration
=============

The Kronos executor configuration file is a JSON object that may contain the following properties:

General configuration
=====================

==================  =======  ==================================================================================
Property            Type     Description
==================  =======  ==================================================================================
execution_context   string   Name of the execution context (see :mod:`kronos_executor.execution_context`)
job_dir             string   Output directory
job_dir_shared      string   Shared input/output directory
execution_mode      string   Job-dependency mechanism: "events" or "scheduler"
event_batch_size    integer  Number of events processed by the executor at once (if execution_mode is "events")
n_submitters        integer  Number of processes submitting jobs
==================  =======  ==================================================================================

If the execution mode is "scheduler", Kronos will submit all the jobs and let the scheduler handle
the dependencies. If it is "events", Kronos will handle the dependencies, which allows finer
control, for instance submitting jobs as soon as some files have been generated by a job rather than
after its completion.

Synthetic application configuration
===================================

======================  =======  ======================================================================
Property                Type     Description
======================  =======  ======================================================================
coordinator_binary      string   Path to the synthetic application executable (kronos-synapp)
procs_per_node          integer  Number of processes per node
read_cache              string   Input directory for the read kernels
read_file_multiplicity  integer  Number of files generated by Kronos for each file size
read_file_size_min      integer  Minimum read size (to be interpreted as 2^<read_file_size_min>)
read_file_size_max      integer  Maximum read size (to be interpreted as 2^<read_file_size_max>)
file_read_multiplicity  integer  Number of files (for each file size) used to randomize the read calls
======================  =======  ======================================================================

If a synthetic app job requires more than ``procs_per_node`` processes, the executor will request
the appropriate number of nodes from the scheduler.
